# Object Orientation with Design Patterns 

CA2: Stock Market

Students of Bsc Computer Science at CCT College Dublin have been tasked to design and implement a simulator of a simplified model of a stock market. The program should simulate both companies and investors, following the specific requirements. When the simulation has been completed, you must present to the user a menu with the list of possible reports for them to see the result. Also, at least three design patterns must be implemented in the project, and at least two of them must be structural or behavioural patterns.

For this project, in particular, it was chosen:

::Builder Pattern: used on Company and Investor classes, to create the objects for both classes 

::Command Patter: used to execute methods to start, to finish and to update the class Trading Day

::Observer Pattern: used to notify the client when the Trade is updated 

::Singleton Pattern: used to get a instance of the class Menu, creating a global point of the class
